If you want to compile in terminal, simply:

cd [root directory, aka this folder]

flutter run -d chrome 

"chrome" is whatever browser you want to use.
I don't know the exact names for other browsers flutter uses, but this one 
should work if you have chrome installed.

You may want to compile in terminal before in IDE in order to generate the
flutter files/folders. Not sure if it generates the same way in IDE compilation.
